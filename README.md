# conference-app

List conferences and register your interest.

Currently in early stages, it's missing for example, a backend ;)

### Running

```
npm run serve
```

This runs the webpack-dev-server in [inline mode](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#inline-mode).


### Todo

- [ ] serverless backend (Firebase?)
- [ ] design
- [ ] hot reload
- [ ] css modules
- [ ] host on github?
- [ ] eslint
- [ ] circleci
- [ ] sourcemaps
- [ ] calendar widget
- [ ] propTypes
- [ ] auth
- [ ] offline capability
