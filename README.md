# conference-app

List conferences and register your interest.

Currently in early stages, it's missing for example, a backend ;)

### Running

```
npm i && npm run watch
```

The app does not include any server at the moment. You can run something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) from root.


### Todo

- backend (Firebase?)
- design
