# conference-app

List conferences and register your interest.

Currently in early stages, it's missing for example, a backend ;)

### Running

```
npm run serve
```

This runs the webpack-dev-server in [inline mode](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#inline-mode).


### Todo

- backend (Firebase?)
- design
